\subsection{Prevalence of the Bland-Altman plot}
%---------------------------------------------%

\citet*{BA86}, which further develops the Bland-Altman methodology,
was found to be the sixth most cited paper of all time by the
\citet{BAcite}. \cite{Dewitte} describes the rate at which
prevalence of the Bland-Altman plot has developed in scientific
literature. \citet{Dewitte} reviewed the use of Bland-Altman plots
by examining all articles in the journal `Clinical Chemistry'
between 1995 and 2001. This study concluded that use of the
Bland-Altman plot increased over the years, from 8\% in 1995 to
14\% in 1996, and 31-36\% in 2002.

The Bland-Altman Plot has since become expected, and
often obligatory, approach for presenting method comparison
studies in many scientific journals \citep{hollis}. Furthermore
\citet{BritHypSoc} recommend its use in papers pertaining to
method comparison studies for the journal of the British
Hypertension Society.

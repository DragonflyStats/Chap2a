Sampling Structures

Herein a distinction must be made between replicate measurements and repeated measurements, based on the sampling structure of both types.

As Carstensen points out in the "MethComp", the structure of the PEFR data is unclear.
As a consequence, a clear description of the sampling structure of the data is advisable.

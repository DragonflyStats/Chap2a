\section{Limits of Agreement}
\section{New}
Computing limits of agreement features prominently in many method comparison studies, further to \citet{BA86,BA99}.
\citet{BA99} addresses the issue of computing LoAs in the presence of replicate measurements, suggesting several computationally simple approaches. When repeated measures data are available, it is desirable to use
all the data to compare the two methods. However, the original Bland-Altman method was developed for two sets of measurements done on one occasion (i.e. independent data), and so this approach is not suitable for replicate measures data. However, as a naive analysis, it may be used to explore the data because of the simplicity of the method.
\citet{bxc2008}  computes the limits of agreement to the case with replicate measurements by using LME models.

\chapter{The Bland Altman Plot}

\section{Bland Altman Methodology}

\subsection{Bias}
Bland and Altman define bias a \emph{a consistent tendency for one
method to exceed the other} [$3$] and propose estimating its value
by determining the mean of the differences. The variation about
this mean shall be estimated by the  standard deviation of the
differences. Bland and Altman remark that these estimates are based on the
assumption that bias and variability are constant throughout the
range of measures.

\section{The Bland Altman Plot}
In 1986 Bland and Altman published a paper in the Lancet proposing
the difference plot for use for method comparison purposes. It has
proved highly popular ever since. This is a simple, and widely
used , plot of the differences of each data pair, and the
corresponding average value. An important requirement is that the
two measurement methods use the same scale of measurement.

\subsection*{Variations}
Variations of the Bland Altman plot is the use of ratios, in the
place of differences.
\begin{equation}
D_{i} = X_{i} - Y_{i}   \label{BA01}
\end{equation}
Altman and Bland suggest plotting the within subject differences $
D = X_{1} - X_{2} $ on the ordinate versus the average of $x_{1}$
and  $x_{2}$ on the abscissa.



\subsection{Criticism of Bland Altman Plot}
Unfortunately the Bland-Altman plot has a fatal flaw: it indicates
incorrectly that there are systematic differences or bias in the
relationship between two measures, when one has been calibrated
against the other. (Hopkins)
\subsection{Treatment of Outliers}
Bland and Altman attend to the issue of outliers in their 1986
paper, wherein they present a data set with an extreme outlier



\section{Paired T tests}
This method can be applied to test for statisitcally significant
deviations in bias. This method can be potentially misused for
method comparison studies.
\\It is a poor measure of agreement when the rater's measurements
are perpendicular to the line of equality[Hutson et al]. In this
context, an average difference of zero between the two raters, yet
the scatter plot displays strong negative correlation.

\subsection*{Components in assessing agreement}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The degree of linear relationship between the two sets \item
The amount of bias as represented by the difference in the
means\item The Differences in the two variances.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bland Altman Plots}
The issue of whether two measurement methods are comparable to the
extent that they can be used interchangeably with sufficient
accuracy is encountered frequently in scientific research.
Historically comparison of two methods of measurement was carried
out by use of matched pairs correlation coefficients or simple
linear regression. Bland and Altman recognized the inadequacies of
these analyses and articulated quite thoroughly the basis on which
of which they are unsuitable for comparing two methods of
measurement \citep*{BA83}.

As an alternative they proposed a simple statistical methodology
specifically appropriate for method comparison studies. They
acknowledge that there are other valid methodologies, but argue
that a simple approach is preferable to complex approaches,
\emph{"especially when the results must be explained to
non-statisticians"} \citep*{BA83}.

The first step recommended which the authors argue should be mandatory is construction of a simple scatter plot of the data. The line of equality ($X=Y$) should also be shown, as it is
necessary to give the correct interpretation of how both methods compare. A scatter plot of the Grubbs data is shown in figure 2.1.
A visual inspection thereof confirms the previous conclusion that there is an inter method bias present, i.e. Fotobalk device has a
tendency to record a lower velocity.



In light of shortcomings associated with scatterplots,
\citet*{BA83} recommend a further analysis of the data. Firstly differences of measurements of two methods on the same subject
should  be calculated, and then the average of those measurements (Table 1.1). The averages of the two measurements is considered by
Bland and Altman to the best estimate for the unknown true value. Importantly both methods must measure with the same units. These
results are then plotted, with differences on the ordinate and averages on the abscissa (figure 1.2). \citet*{BA83}express the
motivation for this plot thusly:
\begin{quote}
"From this type of plot it is much easier to assess the magnitude
of disagreement (both error and bias), spot outliers, and see
whether there is any trend, for example an increase in
(difference) for high values. This way of plotting the data is a
very powerful way of displaying the results of a method comparison
study."

\subsection{Repeated Measurements }
In cases where there are repeated measurements by each of the two
methods on the same subjects , Bland Altman suggest calculating
the mean for each method on each subject and use these pairs of
means to compare the two methods.
\\
The estimate of bias will be unaffected using this approach, but the estimate of the standard deviation of the differences will be too small, because of the reduction of the effect of repeated
measurement error. Bland Altman propose a correction for this.
\\
Carstensen attends to this issue also, adding that another approach would be to treat each repeated measurement separately.

\subsection{Criticism of Bland Altman Plot}
Hopkins[$8$] argues that the plot indicates incorrectly that there
are systematic differences or bias in the relationship between two
measures, when one has been calibrated against the other.
\\
An Evaluation of the correlation between the difference and means
complement the analysis.
\\
Bland and Altman caution that the calculations are based on the
assumption that the data is normally distributed. This can be
verified by using a histogram. If Data is not normally
distributed, it can be transformed.



%============================================================================================================================== %






The scientific question at hand is the correct approach to
assessing whether two methods can be used interchangeably.
\citet{BA99} expresses this as follows:
\begin{quote}We want to
know by how much (one) method is likely to differ from the
(other), so that if it not enough to cause problems in the
mathematical interpretation we can ... use the two
interchangeably.
\end{quote}



Consequently, of the categories of method comparison study,
comparison studies, the second category, is of particular
importance, and the following discussion shall concentrate upon
it. Less emphasis shall be place on the other three categories.

 \bigskip Further to \citet{BA86}, 'equivalence' of two methods expresses
 that both can be used interchangeably.
\citet[p.49]{DunnSEME} remarks that this is a very restrictive
interpretation of equivalence, and that while agreement indicated
equivalence, equivalence does not necessarily reflect agreement.

The main difference between Myers proposed method and the Bland
Altman is that the random effects model is used to estimate the
within-subject variance after adjusting for known and unknown
variables. The Bland Altman approach uses one way analysis of
variance to estimate the within subject variance. In general, the
random effects model is an extension of the analysis of the ANOVA
method and it can adjust for many more covariates than the ANOVA
method



\subsection{Criticism of Bland Altman Plots}

An Evaluation of the correlation between the difference and means
complement the analysis.
\\
Bland and Altman caution that the calculations are based on the
assumption that the data is normally distributed. This can be
verified by using a histogram. If Data is not normally
distributed, it can be transformed.
\\
Luiz \emph{et al} remarks that that Bland Altman Plot should be
used only for small data sets, as the use of an index will be of
little value to the analysis.
